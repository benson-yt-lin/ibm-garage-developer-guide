This set of learning tasks focuses on how to use Red Hat OpenShift Developer
 Experience to develop and deploy a set of basic cloud-native applications. If also covers the use of common tools designed to help the developer monitor, log and debug their applications.

This self-paced agenda is part of the [Cloud-Native Learning Journey](https://ibm-gsi-ecosystem.github.io/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/)

### Learning Tasks

The learning tasks help you understand the Developer Experience with IBM Cloud and working with an IBM Red Hat OpenShift or IBM Kubernetes managed cluster. These are the getting started and initial setup tasks that help you start a project.

## Self-paced Agenda

Please complete these tasks before attending the first session. This will help you get started quickly with the practical exercises.
